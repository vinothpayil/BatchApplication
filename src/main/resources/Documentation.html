<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This Spring Batch Application is designed for processing a "User" entity. The main objective of batch processing here is reading users from a flat file, processing them, and writing them into a database. This is achieved via a configuration of various components like steps, tasks, and listeners that constitute a sequence of a batch job.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<h3>User Entity</h3>
<code>
    @Entity
    @Data
    @AllArgsConstructor
    @NoArgsConstructor
    @Table(name = "users")
    public class User {
    @Id
    private Long userId;
    private String userName;
    private String userPassword;
    }
</code>

<h3>UserRepository</h3>
<code>
    public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, Long&gt; {
    }
</code>

<h3>BatchConfig</h3>
<p>This is the main configuration class for the Spring Batch job. It includes various beans that are part of the batch processing flow, including Job - the main batch process, composed of one or more Steps, Steps - a step is an independent, specific phase of the batch job, such as reading data, processing it, or writing it to a destination. ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter are parts of a step. JobCompletionNotificationListener is a custom listener to get notification when the job is completed.</p>

<h3>JobCompletionNotificationListener</h3>
<p>A listener class to log information after the job execution is completed. It prints out the users from the database when the job is complete.</p>

<h2>Flow</h2>
<p>
    The batch job (importUserJob) is composed of a single-step (userProcessingStep). When the job is started:
<ol>
    <li>userProcessingStep is executed.
        <ul>
            <li>reader() reads user data from a flat file.</li>
            <li>processor() processes the read data. This step is a pass-though.</li>
            <li>writer() saves the processed users to the database.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>After the job is completed, JobCompletionNotificationListener.afterJob() is invoked, which logs all users in the database.</li>
</ol>
This application is designed to be efficient and able to process large amounts of user data concurrently.
